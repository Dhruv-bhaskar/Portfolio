        <p className='text-white'> Iâ€™m Abdelrahman, a web developer instructor with a passion for teaching
        and coding. I specialize in React and front-end development, helping
        students build real-world projects and master modern web technologies. I
        also run a YouTube channel, CodeNest, where I create tutorials and
        courses to guide aspiring developers in their journey toward successful
        careers in tech. Outside of coding, I enjoy continuous learning and
        sharing knowledge to inspire others to achieve their goals.</p>
